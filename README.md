# Cribspot Design

Repo for UI, mockups, icons, etc. Most of these were generated using [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) + [Kactus](https://kactus.io/); you'll need to download both these programs to use the designs. If you want image files, just ask Kevin or Jason and they can generate them for you.
